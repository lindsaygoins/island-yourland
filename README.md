# Island & Yourland
A full stack web application that tracks user progress and user collections in the Animal Crossing: New Horizons video game.
Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS. The database was populated with game data using a [web scraper](https://github.com/lindsaygoins/AC-scraper) I created.
  
Hosted [here](https://island-yourland.herokuapp.com/).
